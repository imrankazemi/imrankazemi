Hey, I’m Imran an amateur programmer. I built a few practical applications and put them here. They are nothing fancy, but they demonstrate that I know how to code. 
At the moment I'm pursuing my second year Bachelor of Computer Science (Major in Software Engineering) at Kardan University, 
I’m familiar with a variety of programming languages, including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, C++, and Java, but I'm always willing to learn new skills to enhance my abilities, I’m also eager to meet other software engineers in the area, so feel free to connect!
