Hey, I’m Imran an amateur programmer. I built a few practical applications and put them here. They were nothing fancy, but they demonstrated that I knew how to code. 
At the moment I am pursuing my second year Bachelor of Computer Science (Major in Software Engineering) at Kardan University, I'm always willing to learn new skills to enhance my abilities.
I’m familiar with a variety of programming languages, including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, C++, and Java, but I’m always adding new skills to my repertoire. I’m also eager to meet other software engineers in the area, so feel free to connect!
