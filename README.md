Hello there! I'm Imran, an enthusiastic amateur programmer. I have developed several practical applications that showcase my coding skills. While they may not be extravagant, they serve as a testament to my programming capabilities.

I am well-versed in multiple programming languages such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, C++, and Java. I am constantly seeking to expand my skill set by learning new technologies to improve my proficiency.

I am eager to connect with fellow software engineers in the community, so please feel free to reach out and connect with me!
